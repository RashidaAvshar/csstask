    <h1>The red fox</h1>
    <p class="first-part">Widely held as a symbol of animal cunning, the red fox is the subject of considerable folklore. The red fox has the largest natural distribution of any land mammal except human beings. In the Old World it ranges over virtually all of Europe, temperate Asia, and northern Africa, and in the New World it inhabits most of North America. Introduced to Australia, it has established itself throughout much of that continent. The red fox has a coat of long guard hairs, soft fine underfur that is typically a rich reddish brown, often a white-tipped tail, and black ears and legs. Colour, however, is variable. In North America black and silver coats are found, with a variable amount of white or white-banded hair occurring in a black coat. A form called the cross, or brant, fox, found in both North America and the Old World, is yellowish brown with a black cross extending between the shoulders and down the back. The Samson fox, a mutant strain of red fox found in northwestern Europe, lacks the long guard hairs, and the underfur is tightly curled.</p>

    <h2>Appearance</h2>
    <p>Red foxes are generally about 90–105 cm (36–42 inches) long, about 35–40 cm (14–16 inches) of this being the tail. They stand about 40 cm at the shoulders and weigh about 5–7 kg (10–15 pounds). Their preferred habitats are mixed landscapes, but they live in environments ranging from Arctic tundra to arid desert. Red foxes adapt very well to human presence, thriving in areas with farmland and woods, and populations can be found in many large cities and suburbs. Mice, voles, and rabbits, as well as eggs, fruit, and birds, make up most of the diet, but foxes readily eat other available food such as carrion, grain (especially sunflower seeds), garbage, pet food left unattended overnight, and domestic poultry. On the prairies of North America it is estimated that red foxes kill close to a million wild ducks each year. Their impact on domestic birds and some wild game birds has led to their numbers often being regulated near game farms and bird-production areas.</p>

<h3>Fox Life</h3>
<p>Red foxes mate in winter. After a gestation period of seven or eight weeks, the female (vixen) gives birth to 1–10 or more young (5 is average), called pups (or, less frequently, cubs or kits). Birth takes place in a den, which is commonly a burrow abandoned by another animal. It is often enlarged by the parent foxes. The cubs remain in the den for about five weeks and are cared for by both parents throughout the summer. The young disperse in the fall, once they are fully grown and independent. The red fox is hunted for sport (see foxhunting) and for its pelt, which is a mainstay of the fur trade. Fox pelts, especially those of silver foxes, are commonly produced on fox farms, where the animals are raised until they are fully grown at approximately 10 months of age. In much of their range, red foxes are the primary carrier of rabies. Several countries, especially the United Kingdom and France, have extensive culling and vaccination programs aimed at reducing the incidence of rabies in red foxes.</p>

        <h1>Owl life</h1> 
        <p class="owl">Most owls share an in nate ability to fly almost silently and also <br> more slowly in comparison to other birds of prey. Most owls <br> live a mainly nocturnal lifestyle and being able to fly without <br> making any noise gives them a strong advantage over prey alert <br> to the slightest sound in the night. A silent, slow flight <br> is not as necessary for diurnal and crepuscular owls given <br> that prey can usually see an owl approaching. <br> Owls’ feathers are generally larger than the average birds’ <br> feathers, have fewer radiates, longer pennulum, and achieve smooth <br> edges with different rachis structures. <br> Serrated edges along the owl's remiges bring the flapping of the wing down to a <br> nearly silent mechanism. The serrations are more likely reducing aerodynamic <br> disturbances, rather than simply reducing noise. <br> The surface of the flight feathers is covered with a velvety <br> structure that absorbs the sound of the wing moving. <br> These unique structures reduce noise frequencies above 2 kHz, <br> making the sound level emitted drop below the typical hearing spectrum <br> of the owl's usual prey and also within the owl's own best hearing range. <br> This optimizes the owl's ability to silently fly to capture prey <br> without the prey hearing the owl first as it flies, and <br> to hear any noise the prey makes. It also allows <br> the owl to monitor the sound output from its flight <br> pattern.</p>

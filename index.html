        <h1>Owl life</h1> 
        <p class="owl">Most owls share an in nate ability to fly almost silently and also <br> more slowly in comparison to other birds of prey. Most owls <br> live a mainly nocturnal lifestyle and being able to fly without <br> making any noise gives them a strong advantage over prey alert <br> to the slightest sound in the night. A silent, slow flight <br> is not as necessary for diurnal and crepuscular owls given <br> that prey can usually see an owl approaching. <br> Owls’ feathers are generally larger than the average birds’ <br> feathers, have fewer radiates, longer pennulum, and achieve smooth <br> edges with different rachis structures. <br> Serrated edges along the owl's remiges bring the flapping of the wing down to a <br> nearly silent mechanism. The serrations are more likely reducing aerodynamic <br> disturbances, rather than simply reducing noise. <br> The surface of the flight feathers is covered with a velvety <br> structure that absorbs the sound of the wing moving. <br> These unique structures reduce noise frequencies above 2 kHz, <br> making the sound level emitted drop below the typical hearing spectrum <br> of the owl's usual prey and also within the owl's own best hearing range. <br> This optimizes the owl's ability to silently fly to capture prey <br> without the prey hearing the owl first as it flies, and <br> to hear any noise the prey makes. It also allows <br> the owl to monitor the sound output from its flight <br> pattern.</p>
